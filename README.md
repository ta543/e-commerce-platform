# 🌐 AWS Native E-Commerce Platform: A Journey to Service Mesh and Advanced Observability

## 📜 Overview 

We embarked on a journey to architect a scalable and resilient e-commerce platform on AWS, harnessing Amazon EKS for container orchestration, AWS App Mesh for seamless service mesh integration, and the suite of AWS tools for unparalleled observability. This endeavor was aimed at demonstrating profound expertise within the AWS ecosystem, focusing on infrastructure as code, meticulous automation, stringent security practices, and astute cost optimization.

## 🔑 Key Milestones Achieved

### 📦 Container Orchestration with Amazon EKS
- Successfully deployed the e-commerce platform on Amazon EKS, ensuring high availability across multiple Availability Zones.

### 🕸️ Service Mesh Integration via AWS App Mesh
- Seamlessly integrated AWS App Mesh, achieving enhanced microservices communication, fortified service-to-service security, and granular monitoring with unparalleled control and visibility.

### 🔄 Automated Multi-Stage CI/CD Pipeline
- Implemented an automated CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, covering all phases from build and test to deployment.
- Adopted blue/green deployment strategies in tandem with Amazon EKS and AWS App Mesh, effectively minimizing downtime and mitigating risks associated with updates.

### 🔍  Observability Realized
- Utilized Amazon CloudWatch for exhaustive logging, metrics, and alarms.
- Employed AWS X-Ray for intricate tracing of requests across the microservices.
- Integrated Amazon Elasticsearch Service with Kibana for sophisticated log analysis and visualization.

### 💾 Database Mastery and Caching Efficiency
- Opted for Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora for our relational database needs, prioritizing high availability and automatic failover.
- Enhanced data retrieval speeds by implementing Amazon ElastiCache, using either Redis or Memcached for efficient data caching.

### 🔒 Security and Compliance
- Leveraged AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for comprehensive access control.
- Ensured secure user authentication and authorization within the application using Amazon Cognito.
- Guaranteed encryption in transit and at rest utilizing AWS Certificate Manager and AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

### 🖥️ Frontend Content Delivery Optimized
- Stored static website content on Amazon S3, with Amazon CloudFront ensuring global, low-latency content delivery.

### 💸 Cost Management and Optimization Strategies
- Kept AWS spending in check with AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets.
- Dynamically adjusted resources based on load through Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling, achieving cost optimization.

### 🛡️ Ensured Disaster Recovery and High Availability
- Adopted a multi-AZ approach with Amazon EKS and implemented robust disaster recovery strategies, including Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments and cross-region snapshots.
